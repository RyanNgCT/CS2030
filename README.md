# CS2030 (no `S`)

My first 2k mod experience in NUS. Mind-blowing, jaw-dropping experience under Prof. (Dr) Henry Chia.

Herein lies my notes and code for this monster of a module.

Sem Taken: `AY24/25 Sem 1`

Final Grade: `B+` (maybe could have boosted to `A-` had I not screw up finals)

***Note: There is no warranty on code correctness and spelling. Kindly open a [PR](https://github.com/RyanNgCT/CS2030/pulls) for any bugs / corrections.***
